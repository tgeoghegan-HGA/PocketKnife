'''to do:

Go to location in drive
note
eval




 - Make a latex image of the equation
 - add output units
 - replace  x ≤ y with min(x,y)
         =*\n
        or \n * \n
        in which * contains < or ≤
        replace with "min(strip(split(*)[0], strip(split(*)[1])"

 - replace |x| with abs(x)
    |x|
    Find pairs of "|" not separated by "\n"
    replace the first "|" with "abs("
    replace the second "|" with ")"
    evaluate

 - find someway to parse "print() to "pyautogui.typewrite()"
 - Lookup Similarly spelled words
 - strip "=" signs
 - update "ignored text" to show []s
 - connect "ignored text" to hardcoded input list
 - The in⁴ issue comes from ordering of what gets deleted. "in" gets deleted,
   and then there is only "⁴" which does not get deleted.  this can perhaps
   be solved by ordering the dictiontary or using
    
 - Add math examples to directory

 - What other python functions can be implemented?
 - What other Asteval functions can be used?
 - Mouse inputs? can I trace geometry on the screen?
 - Add Credits and a recipe for goetta
 - search for lower()
 
 - have the program import both the google sheet and the excel file
 - Check the googlesheet / excel file every 5mins for updates
 - Reload Function in folder 
 - everything to left of "=" gets:
    - whitespace stripped
    - commas become underscore
    - program scans subsequent inputs and replaces all
    so that users can have commas and spaces
Tracer
 - HOld down F7
 - Click in sequence
 - Let Go of F7
 - On the keyboard is a drawing of whatever you just traced
 - Why not just use a screenshot?
 - in F7 Mode, there is a screen overlay
 
Lookup
 - HSSRNDs have weird names
 - autocleanup inputs
 COLUMNS: Label, Type, W, Ix
 WHERE: Label LIKE '%HSS6X4%'
 ORDER BY: W ASC
 LIMIT: 5
 - Infill Fy, Fu values in aisc
 - Print all valid categories for a given type
 - Swap the first two lines
 - Better table printout (make sure all items have same "width" of characters
 - Error handling when user input fallacious WHERE statement
 - Several Example  Lookup
 - Match Tablename in Lookup 'From'
 - Lookups for:
    - Rebar
    - Rebar Hooks
    - A325 & A490 Bolts
    - preferred material types A1085, A572, A36, A992
    - Look through "The Secret Book" for things to fast-lookup
 - No newline when typing single AISC Value
 - Graphical comparator for two-column output
 
 - work smarter not harder, or better yet, not at all
Snip to text
Overall
- rename program
- get it on github

db, Bolt, A490, 1/2, N,
"Bolt Example"
"Steel Member Example"
"Rebar Example"
"Dead Loads"
"Live Loads"
Rebar, #4'

Key  -> Input format (

Give all functions camelcase names

What Can I do with shift-F.12
How about hold-down and click?
